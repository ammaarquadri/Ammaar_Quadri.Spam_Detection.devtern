## Task 2: Spam Detection Using TensorFlow in Python

Spam email detection is essential for filtering out unwanted and potentially harmful messages in todayâ€™s digital world. This repository guides you through building a spam email detection model using TensorFlow in Python. We utilize the SMS Spam Collection Dataset from Kaggle, which provides labeled data for training and evaluating our model.

### Task Overview

**Objective:** Build a machine learning model to detect spam emails using TensorFlow.

### Dataset

You can access the SMS Spam Collection Dataset [here](link_to_dataset).

### Task Execution

1. **Data Preparation**
   - **Data Cleaning:** Address missing values, outliers, and duplicates in the dataset. Handle missing values by removing rows or imputing values using techniques like mean, median, or predictive modeling.
   - **Data Splitting:** Divide the dataset into training and test sets. Typically, use a split ratio like 70-30 or 80-20 for training and evaluation.

2. **Building the TensorFlow Model**
   - Construct a machine learning model using TensorFlow for spam email detection. Deep learning techniques can be employed for effective text classification tasks.

3. **Model Evaluation**
   - Evaluate the performance of the model on the test set using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. These metrics provide insights into how well the model identifies spam emails.

4. **Analyzing Model Coefficients**
   - For deep learning models, there are no traditional coefficients like in logistic regression. However, you can analyze the layers, neuron activations, and feature importance to understand how the model makes decisions about spam detection based on text features.

This project provides a comprehensive guide to building and evaluating a TensorFlow-based model for spam email detection, using real-world data to train and validate the model's effectiveness.
